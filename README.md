# SemanticsExtraction
Implementation of NLP pipeline-base system to extract semantics information in form of triples from a text

In this directory there are:
- the .ipynb notebook used to extract the information and to generate the triples and the associated URIs 
- a .txt file containg the triples
- a .csv file containg the URIs 
- the .txt file containing the text used from which the information are extracted

To run the system is sufficient to upload the .txt file containing the text and the .ipynb notebook in Google Drive, mount the notebook where the .txt file is and execute all
the cells in the notebook.
